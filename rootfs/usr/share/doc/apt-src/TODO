Somehow reconcile with other similer tools:

	- apt-build
	- apt-src (the apt patch)

Does not handle source dependencies yet. Build-deps notes:

  - a package like poldhu needs to build after both the kernel and
    pcmcia-source. pcmcia-source in turn needs to build after the kernel..
  - if the kernel is rebuilt, the things that build-dep on it should be
    rebuilt after it

  I could use two fields for this:

  Source-Depends: kernel-source
  Build-After: kernel-source, pcmcia-cs

  So it ensures that kernel-source is installed, and builds poldhu only 
  after both have built. This would call for some way of knowing that the
  sources were built though. Hm.
  
  There is a problem with the kernel-source package really being
  kernel-source-<version>. Perhaps apt-src needs to be changed so you can
  refer to a source package in terms of all the binary packages that that
  source package builds, but also all the packages said binary package
  provides. Hmm, the real trick is where to get that info. Getting it from
  the apt binary cache would be hard, and also misleading, because
  something might not be available in binary form yet. It should really
  parse the debian control file of installed source packages to get this.

Should offer a way to build packages with some environment variables set
the same each time. DEB_BUILD_OPTS and so on. Per-package..

I may want other per-package configurable stuff, like whether to install
debs, whether to build on upgrade, and what debs to install if multiple
build (a-la pine). One idea is to put that in a file in the source tree.
Another is to put it in the status file. Hmm.

Make /usr/src be the default location for root, but not for non-root users?
